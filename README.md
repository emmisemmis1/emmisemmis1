- 👋 Hi, I’m @emmisemmis1, I'm only just now starting to learn a bit of code, and also Figma for prototypes. Would love to recieve feedback on how I can do better :) 
- 👀 I’m interested in working out, watching series and skiing!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning UX and Front end development. 
- 💞️ I’m mainly looking to collaborate on UX and Front end projects, but I'm open to learn as much as I can! 
- 📫 You can reach me here!
- 😄 Pronouns: ... she/her
- ⚡ I can't whistle for the life of me and I fear that I'll never be able to learn.
